File Handling

Read / Write

2 types of files 
- text
- binary => images, audio, video...

3 steps for file handling
- open
- read/write
- close

Modes for opening a file
If we open a text file,
r  -  read
w  -  write
a  -  append
x  -  write
=========================
If we open a binary file,
rb - read binary
wb - write binary
ab - append binary
xb - write binary

r+
w+

read mode 
= we cannot write a file when we open a file in read mode
= if file do not exists, then it will raise error

write mode
= we cannot read a file when we open a file in write mode
= if file exist then it will write the file and if file do not exist then it will create the file and then write it.
= it will always overwrite the file.

append mode
= we cannot read a file when we open a file in append mode
= if file exist then it will write the file and if file do not exist then it will create the file and then write it.
= it doesn't overwrite the file, it will append the data

x mode
= we cannot read a file when we open a file in x mode
= if file do not exist then it will create the file and then write it, if file exist then it will raise error.
= it will always overwrite the file.
